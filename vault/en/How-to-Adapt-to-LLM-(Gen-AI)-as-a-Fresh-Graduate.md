But it's not just for fresh graduates, everyone can read üìö

Today, I'm sharing some experiences, mainly aimed at those in programming, but useful for other fields too.

Currently, there are many AI language tools (LLM) like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and LLaMa that can generate text responses to our questions üí¨. We can ask them questions with text, images, or even videos. However, there's no guarantee that the answers will always be correct. So, how can these tools be beneficial for fresh graduates? ü§î

One interesting thing about these tools is that you don't need deep knowledge to use Gen AI effectively. You can simply ask direct questions about what you're learning or working on, such as:

If you're creating an e-commerce website and face issues like loading a large number of products without slowing down the site or crashing the server due to heavy data transfer, how do you solve that?

Traditionally, when learning something new, we would search Google and read through Stack Overflow, hoping the keywords we type will lead us to the right answers üîç.

In the era of Gen AI, we should try using these tools to answer our questions. For example, try searching:

"I'm writing a website with React. How do you optimize your website when it needs to load and display a lot of data?"

It will spit out technical terms like Lazy Load, Code Splitting, Optimizing Renders, Performance Monitoring, and Profiling, along with explanations ‚ö°Ô∏è. When asking, you'll notice that you can ask in a roundabout way, and it will lead you to the information or terms used in the industry. You can even ask it to provide examples and explain the code. This removes many obstacles in our learning process üòÜ.

Learning in the modern world has changed significantly. We no longer need to join communities to gather industry-specific knowledge or learn the jargon before searching for answers. The language barrier is also lower because we can ask questions in Thai. So, in this era, our focus should shift more towards understanding. Repetitive tasks are handled better by Gen AI, which can write code and design web pages for us, especially if we know how to ask correctly. Just like how we need to ask the right questions to search on Google, Gen AI helps us get our work done faster with fewer people writing code. Ultimately, we still need someone who truly understands to review and lead to the real goal üéØ. Will that person be us? This is where fresh graduates need to adapt, shifting from just being able to work to working effectively and correctly üëç. These tools will help us achieve that.

I hope today's post opens up a new perspective on learning üåü. Next time, I'll share more about how Gen AI can do even more than you think. Stay tuned to see how üîÆ.
