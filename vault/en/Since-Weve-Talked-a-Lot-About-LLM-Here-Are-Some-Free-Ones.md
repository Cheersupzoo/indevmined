Recently, I've been posting a lot about Generative AI 🧠. Today, I want to introduce some free and powerful AI tools that everyone should know about!

🌟 **OpenAI - ChatGPT 4o** 🔗 [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/)

🌟 **Anthropic - Claude 3 Sonnet** 🔗 [https://claude.ai/](https://claude.ai/)

🌟 **Google - Gemini** 🔗 [https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/)

These three tools alone offer a wide range of capabilities. They can accept input in the form of text, images, or audio. If you use Gemini, it can even handle videos. With a $20 subscription, you can get even smarter functionalities. These links provide easy-to-use, free versions with additional features that are accessible to everyone. For example, they can solve complex equations by sending the equations to Python and returning the answers. This is something raw LLMs struggled with, but it's not an issue for these versions 💪.

On the other hand, if you're a developer or tech-savvy 💻 and enjoy exploring the limits of technology, I recommend trying the playground versions of each.

🔹 **OpenAI** 🔗 [https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat](https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat)

🔹 **Anthropic** 🔗 [https://console.anthropic.com/workbench/](https://console.anthropic.com/workbench/)

🔹 **Google** 🔗 [https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts)

When you use these web versions, you'll find that there are many configurable options that can enhance performance. Although they are not free (except for Google's, which is free but requires waiting in a queue), adding $5 can provide substantial usage. If you don't use it all, you can carry it over to the next month. Especially for those who like to ask about the nuances that LLMs handle smoothly, these versions might be much more worthwhile.

Recently, we've seen the launch of ChatGPT-4o 📣, which is impressive in its effort to be accessible to the general public with many convenience features. The next day, Gemini 1.5 Flash was released, offering a much better price point. With such easy access, give them a try and share your experiences in the comments below! ✨
